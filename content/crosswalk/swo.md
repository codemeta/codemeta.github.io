The [Software Ontology (SWO)](http://theswo.sourceforge.net/) is a resource for describing software tools, their types, tasks, versions, provenance and data associated. SWO is part of the JISC funded SWORD project (Software Ontology for Resource Description), an inter-disciplinary effort to capture software descriptions used in the preservation of data. The work is a collaboration between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the University of Manchester.

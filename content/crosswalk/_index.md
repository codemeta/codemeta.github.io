title: "Crosswalks"
---

The codemeta crosswalk provides an explicit map between the metadata fields used by a broad range of software repositories, registries and archives.  Here are the currently available mappings from existing standards into CodeMeta properties.  Mapping onto a common set of properties should facilitate translation between any two crosswalked standards.  The full crosswalk table is [available as a `.csv`](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/tree/master/crosswalk.csv) file on the CodeMeta repository.
